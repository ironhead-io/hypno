	- Checkpoint and merge.
	- Moved all tests and test data into tests/.  All test data now sits in a folder prefixed by the name of the test (e.g. sql -> sql-test)
	- There should never be more than 3 directories here (tests, example and vendor)
	- Deleted all loose, orphaned tests and stream of thought text files.
	- Reorganized 2016-general-election-summary.csv into a file that can be broken up by script and loaded into an SQL database.  Will complete the current commit.
