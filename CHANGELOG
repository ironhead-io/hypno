Where is the rest of my changelog???

	- Fixed a read off by one error at http.c:594, quit reading the whole message
	- Added Selector reference to Recvr body structures.  Should be easy to reference port number now if needed (still don't know how to handle SSL/TLS negotiation yet...)
	- @nw.h: 342-345 - Added (*pre)(...) and (*post)(...) function pointers to Selector structure.  This will allow one to run code before entering the read,process,write loop and run code after all three have completed.  
	- @nw.h: 342-345 - Also added (*read)(...) and (*write)(...) function pointers.  As long as they're in Selector, it shouldn't take up extra space.  Both of these changes are needed for SSL/TLS and any other TCP level protocols to work correctly...	
	- Neither of these have been tested or even run yet... but they're there and compile...
	- Also, the read and write overriding functions will probably change signatures...

	- NOTES:
	- There are a couple of single file SSL/TLS libraries lurking around on Github.  I want to give those a try, but I can fallback on gnutls (cuz it's everywhere) and axtls (because it builds easy and can ship with the program).

	- It's late, I haven't been really cranking that hard on this project today.

	- However, some things did get done.  A good SSL client exists now and works with a regular https server (pcmag.com in this case.  and is defined within tlscli.c)

	- Checkpoint and merge.
	- Moved all tests and test data into tests/.  All test data now sits in a folder prefixed by the name of the test (e.g. sql -> sql-test)
	- There should never be more than 3 directories here (tests, example and vendor)
	- Deleted all loose, orphaned tests and stream of thought text files.
	- Reorganized 2016-general-election-summary.csv into a file that can be broken up by script and loaded into an SQL database.  Will complete the current commit.
