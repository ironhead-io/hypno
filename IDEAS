- lua comes with a package manager
	because it can be configured on a per-user basis, it may
	be a great idea to configure some kind of script in setup/ to 
	introduce packages on a local level


- handling a large multi inundated request server may be easier in Lua than
	in C.  mostly because it supports a lot of things you need to make it happen	


- docs can be self generating sort of
