why?
----
after months I'm still having dumb problems with cf...
no one likes it, for not totally bad reasons...

theoretically, it's not super hard...
- open a socket
- parse the message
- process it via any means
- send it back
- call it a day


why lua?
--------
- builds fine on osx... :| - kind of a pain on Linux... 
- table primitives exist (but may need debugging)
- easy to add dir and read file functions
- some way to run from a config file 
- lua supports packages
