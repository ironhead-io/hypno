can't lie, I kind of like working on this project...
	- convert http functions to be able to return char*s and integers
	- add the xfer-encoding chunked loop to h_read 
	- make sure binary bypasses everything and just sends something back
	- test with a solid number of connections (250-500 is cool)
	- remove dependency on single.[ch]
	- pack responses
	- add wwwroot to the thing
	- does Lua still have to be used? (I don't mind, but it's hard)
	- if so, router and regex need to get finished up
	- write mvc renderer thing
	- fix bug in sq_save... (I mentioned it, I don't know where or what it is - zero results dies badly)
	- fix bug in render
	- and can I do all this before Wednesday evening at 5?
	- lots of other stuff to write too...
	- debug stacks and whatnot...

tests:
	-	write a test suite that can throw GET x <1M
	-	write a test suite that can throw POST x <1M
	-	write a test suite that tests route parsing
	-	load model subtables as filenames
	- js does odd things in chrome, and chrome will throw some crazy names your way ( /:10 and such, hmm... )
	- also don't know how to handle streaming / chunked responses
	- to make things safe, use a fork(), then kill that...


script functions:
	-	model.(*) - the "sum" of all the model files
	-	http.(*)
			cookie.(*) - All cookie info
			session.(*) - Dunno where this goes yet
			request.(*) - All request data
			response.(*) - All response data
			header.(*) - All header data	
	-	db.(*)   - DB access crap


-	write the rest of the loader functions
x		string
x		model evaluation
		function - where does everything go
		view - skip this, useless without working rendering
		query - skip this too, useless without db drivers


- write the rest of the router functionality
		if the route is not found:
			/ =>
				if '*' or '/regex/' is available
					call it
				else if 'default' or some function named default
					call it	
				else
					throw 404

			/abc => 
				if '*' or '/regex/' is available
					call it
				else
					throw 404

			/abc/def =>
				if '*' or '/regex' is available
					call it
				else if 'levels before (abc in this case)' contains 'expects', '*', or '/regex/'
					call it
				else
					throw 404


- rendering
		I may have to add new hashes and use fpointers
		basic find and replace works (but needs more testing)
		script execution should also work but will take some modification
			fail/throw exception when something doesn't work
	
- database drivers 
		SQlite first
		Postgres and MySQL second
