sigh...
=======
x loader seems to work with 'falafel'

x remember: BIG hashes (until I get a chance to rewrite this)
now, using the Loader structure, it should be pretty easy to write the rest of this...
goes in the http func
	while ( loader ) {
		if ( loader->type == FUNCT )
			a = loader->content( ... )
		else if ( loader->type == STR )
			a = loader->content
		else if ( loader->type == MODEL )
			a = lua_exec( loader->content )
		else if ( loader->type == VIEW )
			a = parse( loader->content )
		else if ( loader->type == QUERY )
			a = sql_do( loader->content )
		else {
			die... with 500 or 401 or whatever...
		}
	}
	bf_add( a, ... )



- after writing the top sequence
- try running this thing for real
- does it work?  does it crash?




keep me handy
=============
	- handle a socket
		-s, -k = start, kill a server via hypno
		open it 
		receive data from it
		see what came parsed
		send data through it
		close it

	- database drivers:
		-t [ mysql, sqlite3, postgresql, etc ] = test database drivers via hypno-test
		sqlite3
		mysql
		postgresql
		maybe one of the nosqls depending on need

	- routing
		-u <file> = test a router setup via hypno (no json)
		interpret the routes in a file as they relate to code

	- templating
		-f <file> = test templates with data and files, 
		-d {} or "select * from etc;" =  you'll need some sort of lua data 
		be able to do raw replacements
		be able to do scripting in the language (use the language)
		
	- tooling
		this can be done from c too... no reason not to, but it can always be removed
		-c <dir> ...
		or
		--create-from <file> 
		shell script for now... is fine....
		can't move quickly w/o it
		create new directories and route structures
		remove directories
		possibly view what's in those directories

	- handle the request / response chain
		obvs, there's nothing here...
		give the user some variables to choose from
		be able to set things that the user should be able to set
		after parsing, basic routes are always needed:
		/dump
		/debug
		/etc...

	- run unit tests
		-t = run unit tests via hypno...	



router
======
x	break url,
x	check each portion for a match in the table
x		*use strcmbd to append new url poritions to the buffer ( x, x.y, x.y.z, etc... )

	since there is one linear data structure, the same thing can always run...


	
	if match found
			now there's another data structure, use that...
		check type:
			table =
				if the url still has parameters, check for any other values 
					the problem is here, is that /check/:id could happen, where ID is required...  
					 but even then, expects can handle this... tell it that the parameter received should be something...
					continue
				if not, 
					check for 'expects' to validate values supplied
					check for 'model' and 'view' tables or values to evaluate
			string =
				return it
				would be incredibly useful to return the same named items... in model and app
			number = 
				return it
			funct  = 
				execute and return its result
			sql?   = 
				should reutrn formatted data, maybe specify the datatype... 
				just thinking crazy
