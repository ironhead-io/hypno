nw

remove old dependencies in nw (i thought they were gone already)
run those tests
get smarter with automation



add all dependencies and test
-----------------------------
nw
http
single.[ch]
duktape.[ch]
	I will always control this build
sqlite.[ch]
	I CAN control this build, but it's best if I don't...
	A flag should allow me to specify the build path when building "sqrooge"

----
after months I'm still having dumb problems with cf...
no one likes it, for not totally bad reasons...



lua
---
test a LOCAL build of lua with 5.2.4 and 5.3.x
keep it in vendor
