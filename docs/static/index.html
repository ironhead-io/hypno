<h1>hypno</h1>

<p>A low maintenance library and tools for web development.</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>hypno depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lua v5.3 or greater</li>
<li>GnuTLS 2.0 or greater</li>
</ul>


<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Hypno is slowly moving over to GNU autoconf for a consistent build process.
Even in its current state, it still needs no exotic flags to build on
different platforms.</p>

<h4>Debian</h4>

<p>Instructions for Debian ought to translate to other apt-based distributions.</p>

<pre>
# Install the following dependencies
$ apt install liblua5.3-dev gnutls-dev make

# Get hypno via Git
$ git clone https://github.com/zaiah-dj/hypno.git

# Make and install
$ cd hypno && make && make install

# Run the examples at port 2222
$ make examples
</pre>


<h4>Fedora</h4>

<p>Instructions for Debian ought to translate to other yum-based distributions.</p>

<pre>
# Install dependencies
$ yum install lua-devel gnutls-devel make

# Get hypno via Git
$ git clone https://github.com/zaiah-dj/hypno.git

# Make and install
$ cd hypno && make && make install

# Run the examples to see the code in action.
$ make examples
</pre>


<h4>Arch &amp; others</h4>

<p>Arch happens to be the distribution that hypno is developed on and
it is a fairly straightforward process to build there.</p>

<pre>
# Install dependencies
$ pacman -Sy lua gnutls

# Get hypno via Git
$ git clone https://github.com/zaiah-dj/hypno.git

# Make and install
$ cd hypno && make && make install

# Run the examples to see the code in action.
$ make examples
</pre>


<p>SuSE, Slackware, Gentoo and others have not been tested yet, but the
steps boil down roughly to the same thing.</p>

<h3>Windows (via Cygwin)</h3>

<p>The Cygwin build is pretty close to what it would be on a typical
Linux system.  Dependencies can be grabbed either through the command-line
or through setup.exe.  That said, if you are not already using
<a href="https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg">apt-cyg</a>,
you&rsquo;re missing out.</p>

<p>To install the dependencies via <code>apt-cyg</code>, try the following:</p>

<pre>
$ apt-cyg install gnutls-devel lua-devel lua
</pre>


<p>To install the via the setup.exe program, just search for the following
names: <code>gnutls-devel</code>, <code>lua-devel</code>, <code>lua</code>.</p>

<p>The program should find the newest versions and install them.</p>

<p>You will also need <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code> if you do not typically build software
in your Cygwin environment.</p>

<p>The rest of the build steps are follow what would be done a regular Linux
system.</p>

<pre>
# Get hypno via Git
$ git clone https://github.com/zaiah-dj/hypno.git

# Make and install
$ cd hypno && make && make install

# Run the examples at port 2222
$ make examples
</pre>


<p>NOTE: In my opinion, running Hypno on Cygwin is really just
useful for quick tests.  The emulation and utilities used to get that
Linux feel just aren&rsquo;t fast enough for production-level performance.</p>

<h3>OSX</h3>

<p>The OSX build needs a bit of work.   Building Lua manually and linking against
that seems to be the best solution for now.</p>

<p>The OSX build also requires brew, which requires XCode and XCode&rsquo;s command line
tools.</p>

<h4>Getting Dependencies via Brew</h4>

<p>The GnuTLS dependency can be grabbed via Brew.  Hypno will also require <code>pkg-config</code>
to find all of the libraries after installation.</p>

<pre>
$ brew install gnutls pkg-config
</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, the Lua package downloaded with Homebrew does not ship with
it&rsquo;s headers or a library.  So we&rsquo;ll need to create one ourselves.</p>

<h4>Getting and Building Lua</h4>

<p>There are three steps to building Lua manually.</p>

<ol>
<li>Visit http://www.lua.org/download.html</li>
<li>Download Lua 5.3.6 from http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.6.tar.gz</li>
<li>Build the library and install it.</li>
</ol>


<p>We can do all of this via the command line.</p>

<pre>
$ curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.6.tar.gz
$ tar xzf lua-5.3.6.tar.gz && cd lua-5.3.6
$ make macosx && make install
</pre>


<h4>Building Hypno</h4>

<p>Building Hypno now will be simliar to other Linux based builds.</p>

<pre>
# Get hypno via Git
$ git clone https://github.com/zaiah-dj/hypno.git

# Make and install
$ cd hypno && make && make install

# Run the examples at port 2222
$ make examples
</pre>




<!-- ## Using the CLI -->


<!--  -->


<!-- Hypno can create its own application directories like other big frameworks.  It's usage is something like this: -->


<!--  -->


<!-- Flags                 | Function -->


<!-- -----                 | -------- -->


<!-- -c, --create [dir]    | Create a new application directory here. -->


<!-- -e, --eat [url]       | Feed this a certain URL and see how it evaluates. -->


<!-- -l, --list            | List all sites and their statuses. -->


<!-- -a, --at [dir]        | Create a new application directory here. -->


<!-- -n, --name [name]     | Use this as a site name. -->


<!-- -d, --domain [domain] | Use this domain. -->


<!-- -v, --verbose         | Be verbose. -->


<!-- -h, --help            | Show help and quit. -->


<!--  -->


<!-- So, if I want to create a new site that can be served from anywhere, this command would let that happen. -->


<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>App Development</h3>

<p>Hypno&rsquo;s greatest use is as a general purpose web application server.  It can be extended to serve applications in a variety of languages, but first and foremost relies on Lua for the generation of what we&rsquo;ll call models.  For those familiar with the concept of MVC, a model is nothing more than a set of business logic.   Views by default are handled with a Mustache-esque (<a href="https://mustache.github.io">Mustache</a>) templating language.</p>

<p>Hypno relies on three tools to work together in tandem: a server (hypno-server), a cli tool for administration (hypno-cli), and a testing engine (hypno-harness).   More information can be found #here, #here and #here.</p>

<p>The folllowing command will create a new instance for your web application.</p>

<pre>
$ hypno-cli -d /path/to/your/directory
</pre>


<p>There are some additional options that will allow you to customize the domain name used, any static paths, and more.</p>

<p>If we <code>cd</code> into the newly created directory, we&rsquo;ll have a simple structure that looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
app/
assets/
config.example.lua
config.lua
db/
favicon.ico
lib/
misc/
private/
ROBOTS.TXT
sql/
src/
views/
</pre>


<p>Each one of the folders serves its own purpose, but that is slightly beyond the scope of this initial documentation.  See #here for more.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>The file <code>config.lua</code> contains the application&rsquo;s title, fully qualified domain name, routes (manually specified) and a database connector depending on what kind of backend is in use (see #connectors for more info).  An example config file is below.</p>

<pre>
return {
    -- Database(s) in use 
    db = "sqlite3://db/roast.db",

    -- Title of our site
    title = "domo.fm",

    -- Fully qualified domain for our site
    fqdn = "domo.fm",

    -- Static assets
    static = { "favicon.ico", "ROBOTS.TXT", "/assets" },

    -- List of routes for our site
    routes = {
        -- home
        ["/"] = { model="clients",view="index" },
        ["login"] = { model="login",view="index" },
        ["logout"] = { model="logout",view="index" },
        ["dump"] = { model="dump",view="dump" },
        ["add-user"] = { model="add-user",view="index" },
        ["remove-user"] = { model="remove-user",view="index" },
        ["profile"] = { 
            [":id"] = {
                model="user"
            , view="user" 
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>As you can see, our config file also specifies some default static paths that are needed for a majority of front-facing web applications.  These are <code>favicon.ico</code>, <code>ROBOTS.TXT</code> and anything under the <code>assets/</code> directory.  Editing the <code>/assets</code> path will, of course, modify which resources are accessible.</p>

<p>Notice the <code>db</code> key and value.   Hypno comes with both SQLite and MySQL drivers out of the box, and we can choose either by specifying the type of driver via URI and either a file or connection string depending on the desired backend.</p>

<p>Lastly, the config file expects a few keys by default, but we are free to add much more as needed.  For example, if we would like to keep track of a Google site verification ID, it can be done via something like the following:</p>

<pre>
return {
    -- Database(s) in use 
    db = "sqlite3://db/roast.db",

    -- Let's add a Google verification key here.
    google_site_verification = "28349243-0234234-23423940",

    -- The rest of the keys
    ...
}
</pre>


<p>Since the config table is accessible to all Lua models, we can access this key from one of our models via <code>config.google_site_verification</code>.</p>

<h3>Routes</h3>

<p>Routes defined in <code>config.lua</code> follow a simple key value type of format.  For example, the following declaration:</p>

<pre>
return {
    -- ....omitting the rest of the keys for brevity 
    routes = {
        ["/"] = { 
            model = "home"
        , view = "home"
        }
    ,   ["namaste"] = {
            model = "peace"
        ,   view = "peace"
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>&hellip;will define two routes for this website.  One for root (/) and one for /namaste.</p>

<p>hypno generates messages by executing the code in the files defined by the model key, and either returning that in a serialized format, or loading a view and sending the model output through that.  This means for our &ldquo;/namaste&rdquo; endpoint above, that hypno expects to find a file titled <code>$DIR/app/peace.lua</code> when looking for a model.  If hypno does not find it, it will return a 500 error, since the engine cannot find a required file.  Since we&rsquo;ve also defined a view, hypno will expect to find a file titled <code>$DIR/views/peace.tpl</code>.   Errors in the template will return a 500, explaining what went wrong.  Likewise, a 500 will also be returned if the view file is not found.</p>

<p>The routes table also comes with some helpful conventions to make it easier to design large sites.  One convention is using a comma seperated list to let multiple routes point to the same set of files.  The following example will allow our site to serve requests for <code>/</code>, <code>/nirvana</code>, <code>/namaste</code>, <code>/enlightenment</code>.</p>

<pre> 
return {
    -- ....omitting the rest of the keys for brevity 
    routes = {
        ["/"] = { 
            model = "home"
        , view = "home"
        }
    ,   ["namaste,nirvana,enlightenment"] = {
            model = "peace"
        ,   view = "peace"
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>Reusing the same example, with a slight modification, let&rsquo;s illustrate one way to serve different models.</p>

<pre> 
return {
    -- ....omitting the rest of the keys for brevity 
    routes = {
        ["/"] = { 
            model = "home"
        , view = "home"
        }
    ,   ["namaste,nirvana,enlightenment"] = {
            model = "@" -- What does this do?
        ,   view = "peace"
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>Whenever the <code>@</code> symbol is specified in a model or view, hypno will search for a file matching the <i>active route</i>.  Using the the code above, if we get a request for <code>/namaste</code>, hypno now will expect a file named <code>$DIR/app/namaste.lua</code> to exist.  <i>One caveat to the <code>@</code> symbol evaluation, is that it does not work well with the home page requests.   This will change in a future version of hypno, but for right now, <b>just don&rsquo;t do it</b>.</i></p>

<p>Lastly, the <code>model</code> and <code>view</code> do not always have to point to a string.   We can use both strings and tables and come up with some interesting combinations.  Let&rsquo;s say, for example, that we have a specific header that we want to load when serving requests for the home page.</p>

<pre> 
return {
    -- ....omitting the rest of the keys for brevity 
    routes = {
        ["/"] = { 
            model = "home" 
        , view = { "my-header", "home" }
        }
    ,   ["namaste,nirvana,enlightenment"] = {
            model = "@" -- What does this do?
        ,   view = "peace"
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>Using the code above, our site will now load both <code>$DIR/views/my-header.tpl</code> and <code>$DIR/views/home.tpl</code> when getting a request forthe home page.   This can be extended even further with the <code>@</code> notation, allowing you to serve websites with a common template.  Making one last modification to our code above, we can modify the route table to load a header and footer when serving requests for <code>/namaste</code>, <code>/nirvana</code> and <code>/enlightenment</code>.</p>

<pre> 
return {
    -- ....omitting the rest of the keys for brevity 
    routes = {
        ["/"] = { 
            model = "home" 
        , view = "home"
        }
    ,   ["namaste,nirvana,enlightenment"] = {
            model = { "always-load-me", "@" }
        ,   view = { "head", "@", "tail" }
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p></p>

<h3>Models</h3>

<p>Most any Lua code can be used when writing business logic, and packages can be installed via LuaRocks for extended functionality.  Additionally, Hypno comes with a large set of extensions that allow for a more cohesive experience when doing certain operations.  For example, the db module allows for fairly seamless (though simplistic one-time) connections to a few different dbms systems.   Sessions and common encoding/decoding routines also ship with Hypno, so unless there is a need for an encoding that does not exist, the engine will be able to serve most needs.</p>

<p>There are no real restrictions on models returned, but at the very least we&rsquo;ll need something like the following for a model to work:</p>

<pre>
return {}
</pre>


<p>A more realistic model will look more like this:</p>

<pre>
-- Typical model
return {
    site_title = "My Fresh, Clean Website"
, site_author = "Juicy M. Johnson"
, site_rels = { 
        { key = "Fresh" }
    ,   { key = "Clean" }
    ,   { key = "Spick & Span" }
    }
}
</pre>


<h3>Views</h3>

<p>Views are composed of simple mustache-like templates matching the keys that are returned from your models.  For example if we have code like this in a file called <code>example.lua</code>:</p>

<pre>
return {
    number = 234234
, title = "List of Healthy and Unhealthy Foods"
, set = {
        { calories = 15, food = "Seltzer" }
    ,   { calories = 1457, food = "Burger" }
    ,   { calories = 712, food = "Bowl of Pho" }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>a template containing the following markup:</p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{{ #set }}
    &lt;li&gt;A "{{ .food }}" has {{ .calories }} calories.&lt;/li&gt;
{{ /set }}
&lt;/ul&gt;
Document #{{ number }}
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>


<p>will render something like this:</p>

<pre>
&lthtml&gt;
&lth2&gt;List of Healthy and Unhealthy Foods&lt/h2&gt;
&ltul&gt;
    &ltli&gt;A "Seltzer" has 15 calories&lt/li&gt;
    &ltli&gt;A "Burger" has 1457 calories&lt/li&gt;
    &ltli&gt;A "Bowl of Pho" has 712 calories&lt/li&gt;
&lt/ul&gt;
&lt/html&gt;
</pre>


<h2>Tools</h2>
