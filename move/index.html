Here's a real webpage. 
Don't get discouraged now.
Finish this first, then figure it out...

<pre>
language choices
	Lua - works with server and is easy to manage
		I'd be happier with Lua b/c it's a simple language that most anyone can figure out
	Go - really nice and comes with all of this shit
		BUT, it's harder to manage if you're trying to go another way


server and whatnot
	tests
	crashes
		should never crash
	speed
		how fast is this compared to Apache or nGinx		
	ease of Apache or nGinx
		Apache can have its own modules - https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/developer/modguide.html
		

SSL	
	tests
		what are we testing?
	ssl package for Lua: either write your own or use someone else's
		https://github.com/brunoos/luasec/wiki
	how long would that SSL book take to digest?
		has to be debugged and run and whatnot	
	how to generate certificates
		&lt;type the command line here...&gt;
	Let's Encrypt certificates
	Can you succinctly explain SSL and TLS?


Documentation
	no tests needed :)
	Documenting everything is the best solution
	And the best thing for your customers if they are there


SMTP
	tests
		what are we testing?
		how long to write the test data?
	smtp package for Lua:
		http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/smtp.html
		https://github.com/moteus/lua-sendmail
		https://github.com/duhoobo/lua-resty-smtp
	roll your own since it's easy to parse it (but it's long)
		don't know how long this will take
	email newsletters that render right in different clients


Security
	tests
		what are we testing?
		how long to write the test data?
	This is kind of a big deal, but how do I actually do it?
	HTTPS + Green Bar
	Hardened systems either one system that runs one site, or a big system that runs a lot 
	I've thought about this a lot
		close any hole (only my server should be running and that's it, maybe ssh)
		don't use a bunch of shit	
		do not run as root, chroot to some nobody bitch ass user
		run a firewall
		use no other daemons (sqlite is it, no cron, no crazy loggers)
		watch for any security holes in the framework (c is simple, but error prone)
	Some more sites for research:
		http://its.virginia.edu/unixsys/sec/
		http://lp.cyberark.com/rs/cyberarksoftware/images/wp-ten-pains-of-unix-07-18-14-final-en.pdf	
	DDOS protection can be done via some 3rd party service, that was my biggest scare


Example Sites
	...


Backups
	rsync all day
	or git... this is trivial
		

Responsive Design
	tests
		what are we testing?
		how long to write the test data?
	media queries
	bootstrap
	documented stuff (try to use modules for yourself)


HTML5 / CSS Reference
	Print all of this crap out
	Know what you can do
	Then you know what you're asked for


Front-end Middleware / Packages
	Angular makes this VERY easy
	Haven't tried vue yet
	

Back-end Middleware / Packages
	Sessions and Login
		session management that works everywhere

	Stores
		build a store with paypal or something else
		old code can be used to get it working

	OAuth
		build a module that can handle this
		and also build some stuff that helps talk to other servers

	why not wordpress?
		security?


Staff Needs
	If there really will be 1000 customers, I'll need some staff:
	support - who can help get this stuff done?
	better programmers - ...?
	copywriters - I know NOTHING about this 
	designers - I am not great at this
