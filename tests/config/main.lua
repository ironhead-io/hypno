-- main.lua - Just output a simple message.
-- print( "Hello!  Lua seems to work fine." )
-- return "Hello!  Lua seems to work fine."
-- print( "newenv is: ", newenv )


-- Parse the path from here
	-- EXPECTED: /asdfsadf 



-- What do you load, model and view-wise?
	-- Whatever came from the path...?
	-- for m in models; do load( m ); done
	-- for v in views; do load( v ); done
	-- io.write a message and just write errors once from Lua



-- To do this you would have to:
	-- bag up a framework and use some tooling...



-- Why is this frustrating?
	-- Idk, testing will suck ass...
	-- Harder to do "scopes"
	-- Speed will probably still not be comparable
	-- Hmm... not sure what else...
	-- You could bag up a 

return "a"
