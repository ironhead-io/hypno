?	lil-model - parse and interpret a simple model (like one file)
	big-model - parse and interpret a model composed of multiple files (like 2 or 3)
	xl-model - parse and interpret a model composed of a ridiculous amount of files (like 50+)
	lua-model - parse and interpret a model composed of a file using Lua standard library stuff
